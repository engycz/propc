v1.16e Maintenance Release 08/11/07
***********************************
Use OPCENUM to when opening TOpcSimpleClient unless at design time.


v1.16d Maintenance Release 08/11/07
***********************************
Fixed bug in handing boolean arrays in prOpcVarUtils.


v1.16c Maintenance Release 29/09/07
***********************************
1.16c.1 Added new build to support "Delphi 2007 for Win32". Setup program is 
D11Setup.exe.


v1.16b Maintenance Release 08/04/07
***********************************
1.16b.1 prOpcEnum.pas
Fixed memory leak in function OpenReg when failed to connect to remote registry.

1.16b.2 prOpcEnum.pas
Added new (optional) parameter to GetServerInfo: Options: TServerSearchOptions.
if this includes soUseOpcEnum then the Opc enumerator service (OpcEnum.exe) is
used to get the information, rather than remote registry access. Note that if
this option is used, then the 'Vendor' parameter always returns empty, as this
information is not available using OpcEnum.


v 1.16a Maintenance Release 06/02/07
************************************
1.16a.1 Added basic support for Async write to SimpleClient component. Server must
support IAsyncIO2.


v 1.16 Upgrade Release 10/02/06
*******************************
Support for Delphi 2005 and Delphi 2006. The Delphi 2005 build is included for customer's
convenience but Delphi 2005 is not an officially supported platform for prOpcKit. 


v 1.15h Maintenance Release 30/06/05
************************************
1.15.1 prOpcClient.pas
Modify 'TOpcGroup.DisconnectServer' to avoid throwing exception if connection point cannot
be found (e.g Server has unexpectedly died).


v 1.15g Maintenance Release 27/01/05
************************************
1.15.6.1    TItemIdList now ignores duplicates to allow InvalidateNamespace with
            'keep existing'. This was a bug.

1.15.6.2    Fixed AV in InvalidateNamespace



v 1.15f Maintenance Release 15/06/04
************************************
1.15f.1 prOpcClient.pas
Added property TOpcGroup.Timebias. This is initialised from the 
server when the group is connected.

1.15f.2
Added property TOpcGroup.GroupInterface to allow access to underlying
OpcInterfaces.


v 1.15e Maintenance Release 03/04/04
************************************
Added "ForceDisconnect" function to Group and ClientInfo to allow 
disfunctional clients to be disconnected from the server

Fixed bug in TAsyncTask - ActiveItemList in TRefreshTask was being
freed before the Task was processed. This was quite a nasty bug
but there have been no reported issues from the field traceable to 
this problem - it was detected while carrying out routine testing
of the implementation of Forced disconnect.


v 1.15d Maintenance Release 15/11/03
************************************
Minor update now includes prOpcKit.dcp in distribution.


v 1.15c Maintenance Release 17/10/03
************************************
Version resource rationalised. This is now marked 1.15.3 rather 
than 1.1.5.0 which was a bit obscure, even to me.

Bug in prOpcRttiServer 
EUInfo was returned for Boolean items which is correct for Native
Boolean but incorrect for Variant Bool since true = -1. This was
causing an AV in the latest release of Terravic tools - which now
support EUInfo. Which is nice providing one does not have bugs in 
one's implementation.

Slight change to TServerSelectDlg.Execute - 'Options' parameter
added to allow use of OpcEnum.


v 1.15b Maintenance Release 19/03/03
***********************************
* Fixed bug in prOpcServer.pas. Memory Leak in IOPCAyncIO2.Refresh2.
* Fixed broken example ClientDemo3


v 1.15 Maintenance Release 20/09/02
***********************************
* Support for D7
* Fixed broken example prDemo5


v 1.14 Upgrade Release 14/04/02
*******************************
 * Detailed release notes now found in prOpcKit.doc.
 * Added support for hierarchical browsing 
 * Removed Rtti code from prOpcServer.pas and moved it to another unit. This 
   will require small source code changes to servers that use Rtti.
 * Changed TOpcSimpleClient so that Items in groups are no longer sorted by 
   name. This was very eccentric behaviour, but the change may have an impact
   on existing clients. See prOpcKit.doc.
 * Added facility to allow servers to detect and act on COM errors when making
   callbacks to clients.
 * Minor bug fixes to prOpcServer. 
 * Evaluation Edition no longer links Masks.dcu and ignores szFilterCriteria 
   parameter to IOPCServerBrowseServerAddressSpace.BrowseOPCItemIDs.
 * Includes Very Simple Client prOpcVSC.
 * Memory leak in TOpcGroup.SyncRead (and possibly others) fixed.

v 1.13a Maintenance Release 10/09/01
************************************
 * Fixed broken demo prDemo9. Minor updates to prOpcKit.doc and prOpcKit.hlp.

v 1.13 Maintenance Release 15/08/01
***********************************
  * Toolkit validated with Terravic Visual OPCTest Validator.
  * IOPCSyncIO.Read did not set the client handles in the returned structures.
    This was quite a nasty bug and has been fixed. Fortunately, no problems have
    been reported from this but existing servers should be updated in due course.
  * Minor compliance changes in prOpcServer, mostly concerned with correctly
    responding to invalid input. See prOpcServer.pas for details.
  * Minor corrections to prOpcKit.doc
  * There was a serious bug in prOpcServer.pas which meant that any attempt
    to access a null string ('') using DataAccess 1.0a would result in an
    access violation on the server.
  * String Array items did not work on Servers compiled with Delphi 6. This was
    caused by a bug in prOpcVarUtils, which has been fixed.
  * Added support for Data Access 1.0 connections to servers exporting
    array-type items.
  * Slight change in the way strings are marshalled onto Data Access 1.0
    streams. Previous versions included the null terminator in the byte count,
    which was wrong. Some clients require this (incorrect) behaviour so there
    is now a server option soIncludeNullInDA1ByteCount to force this behaviour.

For more detailed information on changes and bug fixes see comments in
prOpcServer.pas(int) and prOpcVarUtils.pas(int).

v 1.12 Maintenance Release 29/06/01
***********************************
  * New option to force Server to always allocate ppErrors even if the
    the result of the call is S_OK. This is a requirement of Matrikon
    (and possibly other) clients.
  * Now compatible with Delphi 6.0.
  * Changes in distribution format.
  * Minor bug fixes in prOpcServer. See prOpcServer.pas for details.

v 1.11 Maintenance Release 29/05/01
***********************************
  * Minor bug fixes in prOpcServer. See prOpcServer.pas for details
  * Ordering information added to documentation

v 1.10 Upgrade release 30/04/2001
*********************************
Added features:

  (TOpcItemServer)
  * Support for Array Properties
  * TDateTime support for Rtti Properties

New unit prOpcVarUtils to provide some additional Variant
processing routines

Functional Changes
  * Removed GetRttiProxy method. Replaced with RttiProxy property.
  * Removed UseRecursiveRtti method. Replaced with Options method.
  * Rtti is now scanned in virtual method LoadRttiItems.

WARNING
  * Servers implementing GetRttiProxy or UseRecursiveRtti will have
    to be modified.
  * Format of an RttiHandle has changed. Servers implementing
    subscription on Rtti items may have to be modified to account
    for the new format.

No changes on client side.


v 1.01 Maintenance Release 04/04/2001
*************************************
prOpcTypes.pas / int accidentally left out of distribution
Numerous small bugfixes as listed in prOpcServer


v 1.00 Original Release 19/03/2001
**********************************
